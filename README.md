# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This is a Python program that performs Caesar cipher encryption and decryption. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
Encrypt a message by shifting each letter by a user-specified amount.
Decrypt an encrypted message by reversing the shift.
Non-alphabetical characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
How It Works
The program prompts the user to select between encryption or decryption.
The user enters the message to be encrypted or decrypted.
The user specifies the shift value, which determines how many positions each letter is shifted in the alphabet.
Encryption Example
If you choose to encrypt the message "Hello World!" with a shift of 3:

Input: Hello World!
Shift: 3
Output: Khoor Zruog!
Decryption Example
If you choose to decrypt the message "Khoor Zruog!" with a shift of 3:

Input: Khoor Zruog!
Shift: 3
Output: Hello World!
Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your system. The code is compatible with Python 3.x.
